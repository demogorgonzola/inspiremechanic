Kind of Game:
  2d-top-down arena-styled party-based battler. That sounds like shitty
  buzz-words. The player fights with a team of chosen party members to
  try and beat another team by way of using team-tactics with autonomous
  party members via a Suggestion and Cooperation Mechanic.

Core Concepts of Game:
  * Friends (Party Members) are autonomous
  * Beating up other kids and getting beaten is good
  * Emotional state of yourself and others need care
